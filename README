2.  Introduction

This is Proof of Concept software intended to showcase the performance
of efficient CRC implementations on Intel(r) architecture processors.

This program  is used  to benchmark the  performance of  different CRC
algorithm implementations.  This is done  by measuring the  time taken
for  multiple executions  of the  same  function. When  the CPU  clock
frequency is  known, then it is  possible to calculate  the cycles per
byte  factor.  This  method is  a  more universal  way of  performance
measurement than  the one using  the RDTSC instruction since  the time
stamp counter read by the  RDTSC instruction is clocked differently on
different CPU models.

Current performance  measurement also includes the  burden of function
calls  and performance measurement  loops. As  the result  it provides
slightly  more   pessimistic  data  than   the  actual  cost   of  CRC
computation.

Please  note   that  Intel  SpeedStep(r)  and   Intel(r)  Turbo  Boost
Technology affect  reliable cycle measurement.  They  should be turned
off to get actual performance data.


2.1 CRC Algorithms Implemented

- Look-Up Table (LUT)
    - Processes one data byte per iteration
    - Uses one precomputed 256 element table
    - The  element size depends  on the CRC  size. For an 8-bit CRC, the
      total memory occupied by the LUT is:
          1 x  256 x (8 bits / 8  bits) = 256 bytes

- Slice-by-2 (S2)
    - Processes two data bytes in one iteration
    - Uses two precomputed  256 element tables
    - The element size depends on the CRC size. For a 16-bit CRC, the
      total memory occupied by the tables is:
          2 x 256 x (16 bits / 8 bits ) = 2 x 512 = 1024 bytes
    - Other algorithm versions  processing more  bytes  per iteration
      (such as, slice-by-4) are possible.
      However, the space occupied by the look-up tables grows with the
      number of processed bytes in one iteration.

- Slice-by-4 (S4)
    - Similar in concept to Slice-by-2
    - Processes four data bytes in one iteration
    - Uses four precomputed 256 element tables
    - The element size depends on the  CRC size. For a 32-bit CRC, the
      total memory occupied by tables is:
          4 x 256 x (32 bits / 8 bits ) = 4 x 1024 = 4096 bytes

- Carry-Less Multiplication (CLMUL)
    - Uses no lookup tables 
    - Folds a data block into  a  single 16-byte  chunk  with the help of
      precomputed constants
    - Processes 16 data bytes in one iteration
    - Folded 16-byte  is reduced  to 32 bit  value using Barrett reduction.
    - Uses the Intel PCLMULQDQ  instruction (first available on Westmere) 
    - PCLMULQDQ with XMM  registers  works   natively  with  32-bit
      polynomials.
      A 16-bit polynomial  must be promoted to a  32-bit polynomial to
      make use of this algorithm.
      The performance of  the 16-bit and 32-bit CRC using this method
      is identical.
    - It is possible to use CLMUL for CRC sizes smaller than 16.
    - Total memory occupied by constants is:
          3x16 [bytes] + 1x16 [bytes] = 48 + 16 [bytes] = 64 [bytes]
      Five pre-computed constanst are saved in form of three XMM 16
      byte registers. The additional 16 bytes is used to change endianess
      of 16 byte data blocks.

- Internet Protocol Checksum
    Although it is not strictly a CRC computation, the IP one's complement
    checksum implementation has been added to the library.

    There are two checksum type implementations; generic OC16/TCP/IP and
    UDP/IPv4-specific. Each checksum type has two implementations:
        - Vanilla C implementation
        - SSE3-based implementation using Intel intrinsics
    
    Note on the vanilla C implementation and compiler options:

      The current version of the "Makefile" uses the -O2 compilation option and
      effectively prevents compiler vectorization of the code.
      When the -O3 option is used in combination with -msseXX or -mavxX,
      the compiler attempts to vectorize the code. The vanilla C
      implementation qualifies for vectorization and the compiler uses
      vector instructions at compilation time. If vectorized,
      performance of the vanilla C implementation gets better and
      close to the SSE implementation.
      As measured on an Intel(r) Core(tm) i7-3770 platform,
      the vectorized vanilla C implementation is about 20% worse than
      the SSE implementation.
      However, vanilla C code is more portable and more easily takes
      advantage of new architectures. For example, when using a
      4th generation Intel(r) Core(tm) processor, the -msse4.2 option
      can be replaced with -mavx2 and in conjunction with the -O3 option,
      the compiler may provide a better checksum implementation than
      that provided by SSE for this architecture.

3.  Program Compilation

The program compiles on 64-bit Linux* as a user space program.
It has been tested on:
    - Ubuntu* 16.04.1 LTS, 64-bit, kernel 4.4.0, GCC 5.4.0
    - Ubuntu* 15.10, 64-bit, kernel 4.10.0-rc4, GCC 5.2.1
    - CentOS* 7.2, 64-bit, kernel 4.8.4, GCC 4.8.5
    - Fedora* 20, 64-bit, kernel 4.9.0-rc2, GCC 4.8.3

To  compile  the program,  please  run  the  "make" command.

After  successful compilation,  the "crctest"  executable  file should
appear in the folder.


4.  Program Execution

The user space  application benchmarks all of the  available CRCs with
the  corresponding algorithms.  It measures  algorithm  performance in
total time spent [s] and number of cycles per byte. Other command line
arguments allow  the selection of  core affinity, vector size  and the
number of iterations.

Some of available command line options are:

        -h                 :print help
        -c CPUNUMBER       :set the CPU number that will run the thread
        -i NUM_ITERATIONS  :set the number of iterations (in 1000 units)
        -s VECTOR_SIZE     :enter a test vector size

To see all command line argument options please run "./crctest -h".

Example program usage:

./crctest -c 2 -i 1000 -s 1024

This  command pins  the test  thread  to CPU  ID 2,  and runs  1000000
iterations of each CRC algorithm on a 1024 byte data block size.
